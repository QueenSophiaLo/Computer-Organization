Chapter 2

AGENDA
instruction sets
operations of computer hardware
operands of computer hardware

INTRO
instructions - the words of a computer's language
instruction set - the computer's vocabulary
computer languages are similar to each other (easy to pick up on other languages once you learn the others)

THE STORED PROGRAM CONCEPT
the idea that instructions and data of many types can be stored in memory as numbers
the "birth" of software
electronically stored instructions are easy to change leading to the stored program computer (each command/each line of code is stored in memory)

"Manchester Baby" video on slides

ARMv8 and LEG v8
the chosen instruction set is ARMv8
we will be using a subset of ARMv8 instructions (LEGv8 which is intended as a pun)
	LEG: Lessen Extrinsic Garrulity

OPERATIONS OF COMPUTER HARDWARE

ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS
ADD a,b,c
instructs a computer to add variables stored in memory location b and c and put that sum in memory location a
arithmetic instructions perform only one operation and must always have exactly three variables
SUB a,b,c
ADD and SUB are the instructions and a,b,c are operands
Simplicity favors regularity- one of the first  of three underlying principles of hardware design
hardware for a variable number of operands is harder than one for a set number of operands

LEGv8 OPERANDS
operands of arithmetic instructios must be from a limited number of special locations built directly in hardware called registers
LEGv8 registers are 64 bits
word: natural unit of access in a computer, usually a group of 32 bits (now it has become a less specific bit definition)
registers are primitives used in hardware design that are also visible to the programmer when the computer is completed

REGISTER PROS AND CONS
limited number of registers (typically 32 on current computers like LEGv)
This is becuase of the 2nd design principle of hardware technology: Smaller is better

REGISTERS IN MEMORY HIERARCHY
(picture in notes)

REGISTER NAMES
LEGv8 convention is X#
Ex: X0...X30, XZR (Register XZR is always equal to zero)
